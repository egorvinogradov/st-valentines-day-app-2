## Tinder-like web-app for my language school
 
[www.KaplanValentine.com](http://kaplanvalentine.com:8000/) is a simple and funny way to let someone in Kaplan Berkeley Language School know that you like him or her.

Sign up and choose anonymously up to 5 people you like. If someone of these people likes you too, you both will see notification. 

### 1. Sign up via email
Click "Sign In/Up" in the top right corner and select "Create account".

### 4. Wait for notification
If any of those 5 people like you too, you will see a notification. Otherwise, you won't see who likes you and others won't see if you like them.
